##In case of a net camera motion sets the height to the height of the first image read.
#width 320
#height 240
#Motion requires that dimensions of camera image must have both height and width that are a multiple of 16. Th√≠s is
#normally not a problem. All standard sizes like 640, 480, 352, 320, 288, 240, ...etc are multiples of 16.

# Event Gap is the seconds of no motion detection that triggers the end of an event.
# An event is defined as a series of motion images taken within a short timeframe.
# Recommended value is 60 seconds (Default). The value -1 is allowed and disables
